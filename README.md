# ToDoList1
The starter code for the Todo List application was refactored according to the following:

1. In index.js a checkbox to check off the completed to-do activity on the Daily To Do list was included.

2. A delete button with a hover over red X was also created in index.js as an option to remove the activity. 

3. In style.css, a red container background with a blue border was added to enhance the To Do list app.

4. Each activity was sectioned off in a different colored div through nth-child property in CSS. After every five lines of an activity, the color pattern code will repeat.
